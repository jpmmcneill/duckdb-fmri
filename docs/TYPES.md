This file serves as a registry for data types that should be implemented.

## Data Types

[Nipy](https://github.com/nipy/nipy/) has some strong notions of objects.

For example, the [Image](https://github.com/nipy/nipy/blob/9512cd93b7215b4c750be3968a600c06f2bd22f6/nipy/core/image/image.py#L34) object is the core data structure of this package.
